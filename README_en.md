# Organic Products Application (Orgs)

**What is the app and what it is supposed to do:**

The “Orgs” application was created in Alura's course entitled “Android with Kotlin: creating an app”, it is a course aimed at the first contact with Kotlin for Android.

**Using the app**

The app is a list of organic products. On its home page there is a RecyclerView and a FloatActionButton, when clicking to add a new item to the list, 
we have a form with three fields: the name of the product, the description of the product and the price of the product. 
When clicking the save button, the item appears in the list on the home page.

**What was exercised in this project**

As I had already studied Kotlin before, I took the course to remember the implementations in Android, review the language, use of layouts and good practices.

- What is Android, on which platforms do we deliver android apps, use of Android Studio;
- Understand what is the android SDK and android framework (which offer all the resources to create our apps);
- What are Activities, Activity Lifecycle, Layouts and visual components (Views);
- RecyclerView and Adapter;
- List, form and buttons.
- What is AndroidManifest.xml and what do we use it for;
- Creation and use of an emulator to test the app in an android environment;
- AppCompatActivity and AndroidX libraries;
- Data Access Object - DAO;
